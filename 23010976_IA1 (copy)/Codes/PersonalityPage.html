		<p><i>"The two most important days in your life are the day you are born, <br>and the day you find out why."</i>   ~Mark Twain. </p>
	</div>
	
	<div id="explanation">
		<p> Above is a picture of a great man who I look up to, Mark Twain. Samuel Langhorne Clemens, commonly known as Mark Twain was an American Author and Humorist. 
		Mr. Clemens was born on the 30<sup>th</sup> of Novemeber 1835 in Florida, Missouri, US; and was laid to rest on the 21<sup>st</sup> of April 1910 Redding, Connecticut at 
		the age of 74. I see Mr. Clemens as the perfect role model because he found a balance between being humourous and being serious when necessary; because he was a voice for
		economically exploited ex-slaves and also a great comedic figure. The reason I chose Mr. Clemens is because recently I have taken a liking towards some of his work namely; 
		<i> Adventures of Huckleberry Fin(1884), Adventures of Tom Sawyer(1876) </i>, which are well written peices and really moved me. I chose this exact quote, because i found it 
		simple but meaningful because it is really letting you reflect on what gives life true value beyond just being alive.</p>

		<h1 class="head"> How My Personality Impacts My Academic/School Life </h1>
		<p> My strongest personality traits I believe is my Will-power, which profoundly influences my approach to learning and my academic pursuits. This unwavering 
		determination, coupled with my hobby/passion for Arduino Projects and Computer Science, has shaped my educational journey in remarkable ways. </p>
		
		<h2>Willpower as Driving Force</h2>
		<ol type=1>
			<li><b>Overcoming Academic Challenges</b>: My strong willpower enables me tackle difficult subjects head-on. When face with complex concepts in a challenging course, I persist until 
			I grasp the material, often spending extra time studying or seeking additional resources</li>
			
			<li><b>Consistent Performance</b>:  Willpower helps me maintain a steady academic performance throughout the semester. I'm able to resist distractions and stay focused on my studies, 
			even during times when motivation might be low. </li>
	        
			<li><b>Long-term Goal Achievement</b>: By setting ambitious academic goals and leveraging my willpower to stick to them, I've been able to maintain a high GPA while also engaging in 
			extracurricular activities and research projects. </li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Emotional Resilience in Academic Setting</h2>
		<p>My willpower conributes to stron emotional resilience, allowing me to: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bounce back from academic setbacks quickly</li>
			<li>Stay calm under the pressure of exams and deadlines</li>
			<li>Persist through long-term projects without losing steam</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>Hobby: Arduino Projects and how the benefit my Academic Journey</h2>
		<p>My passion for Arduino projects has significantly enhanced my academic experience: </p>
		<ol type=1>
			<li><b>Problem-Solving Skills</b>: Debugging Arduino projects has sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills, which directly translates to improved performance in my computer
			science and engineering courses.</li>
			<li><b>Time Management</b>: Balancing my Arduino projects with academic responsibilities has greatly improved my time management skills. I've learned to allocate my time efficiently 
			between coursework and personal projects.</li>
			<li><b>Interdisciplinary Learning</b>: Arduino projects often require knowledge from various fields such as electronics, programming, mechanics, and even design. This interdisciplinary 
			nature has motivated me to expand my knowledge beyond my primary field of study.</li>
		</ol>

		<p> While looking at the results of the personality test, I can find in it traits corresponding to my self-concept, though some other parts seem less appropriate for me. High scores in introversion, 
		70%, and schizoid tendencies, 68%, I did concur with when considering my preference to be along and survive on my own, as I do firmly consider myself. Accordingly, my will and emotional strength 
		correspond to the high "sectarian" motive of 73%, which probably signals a wish to be focused and independent from the pressures of society. From these results, indications can be drawn about my 
		personal background and, especially, in the way I approach learning or problem-solving.</p>
		
		<p> However, some of these aspects were exaggerated, such as the high scores for "paranoid" or "antisocial" personality disorder at 60% each. I really do not believe these traits define me as a person
		and disrupt my social interactions. As for the overall validity of the test, it truly did highlight many important traits regarding my personality; however, there were some extreme values in some of the
		domains that may reflect the limit of the self-reporting tool, as it sometimes exaggerates certain of my tendencies.</p>
		
		<p> It is a great reflection tool but needs to be taken with a little skepticism as well. It does give insight into the dominant traits, yet so much nuance in personality is out of context for any test 
		to be able to capture. What this test does hint at for me, personally, is that my strengths lie in resilience and independence; it may not be truly representative of the depth of emotional or social interaction
		that takes place with and inside me.</p>
