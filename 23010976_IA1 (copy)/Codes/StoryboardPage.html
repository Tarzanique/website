            <p>A storyboard and a wireframe are both planning tools used in the design process, but they serve different purposes. A storyboard is a visual representation of how a user might progress through a product, app, or website. It's like a comic strip of the user's journey, showing the sequence of screens or interactions they'll encounter. Storyboards help designers and stakeholders understand the overall flow and user experience.</p>
            <p>A wireframe, on the other hand, is a basic visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or app. It's a low-fidelity, schematic layout that outlines the specific size and placement of page elements, site features, conversion areas, and navigation. Wireframes focus on functionality and structure rather than visual design, serving as a blueprint for the final product.</p>
            <p>For this Website in particular, I would say that the colour scheme, feel and layout is consistent throughout the entirety of the website.</p>

            <h2>Home Page Wireframe</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Tare\OneDrive%20-%20MBCC\Desktop\23010976_IA1%20(copy)\Assets\Home.jpg" alt="Home Page Wireframe">
            <p>Above is a picture of the wireframe of my Home/Index page. The general layout of this page will be simple and clear in a way that the main message to the user would be portrayed right away, without burrowing them with information they may not currently need. Being the first page a user opens, the Home/Index page is where they enter into the site's content. The idea is for it to offer an intuitive and inviting introduction.</p>
            <p>The color scheme used will also play a very important part in making it look visually appealing. It contains a light green background that evokes a mood of serenity, freshness, and easiness as the user navigates through the site. This soft tone works well in high contrast to the brighter navigation green to create usability in the recognition of key areas of the site. Complementary shades of green make it cohesive and balanced, which controls the user's focus while keeping things clean and modern. This design balances simplicity and functionality by ensuring that users will find what they need right away with no distractions while setting the tone for the rest of the website.</p>

            <h2>Personal Development Page Wireframe</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Tare\OneDrive - MBCC\Desktop\23010976_IA1 (copy)\Assets\Personal-Dev.jpg" alt="Personal Development Page Wireframe">
            <p>The Personal Development Page is designed to showcase my journey of growth and learning, particularly focusing on the "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn 
			and Chris Widener. The layout is structured and informative, providing a clear overview of key personal development concepts. The page is divided into 
			sections, each representing a "Pillar" from the book. Each section includes a preview, key points, and a notable quote, making the information easily d
			igestible. The use of collapsible sections allows users to focus on specific areas of interest without being overwhelmed
			by information. This consistency in design helps maintain a sense of unity across the website. A unique feature of this page is the inclusion of personal reflections 
			on each Pillar, demonstrating how I've applied these concepts to my life and studies in Modular Computer Studies. This personalization adds depth to 
			the content and makes it more relatable to visitors. The page also includes information about my degree and acquired skills, providing a clear link 
			between personal development and professional growth. This integration of personal and academic information creates a holistic view of my development 
			journey.</p>

            <h2>Professional Page Wireframe</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\Tare\OneDrive - MBCC\Desktop\23010976_IA1 (copy)\Assets\Professional.jpg" alt="Professional Page Wireframe">
            <p>he Personality Page offers insights into my character and how it influences my academic life. The layout is designed to be engaging and personal, 
			starting with a striking visual element â€“ a picture of Mark Twain accompanied by an inspirational quote. The page is structured to provide a comprehensive 
			view of my personality: 1. It begins with a personal hero (Mark Twain) and an explanation of why I admire him, immediately giving visitors a sense of 
			my values and inspirations. 2. The main content focuses on how my personality traits, particularly willpower, impact my academic life. This section is 
			well-organized with clear headings and bullet points, making it easy for visitors to grasp key information quickly. 3. The page includes a visual 
			representation of my personality test results, adding an interactive and data-driven element to the personal narrative. The design likely maintains 
			the green color scheme, but the inclusion of images (Mark Twain's picture and the personality test results) adds visual variety and breaks up the text,
			making the page more engaging. The content balances personal anecdotes with analytical insights, providing a multi-faceted view of my personality. 
			This approach makes the page both informative and relatable, allowing visitors to connect with me on a more personal level.</p>

            <p>TThe Professional Page is designed to present my career aspirations and qualifications in a clear, professional format. It mimics the structure of a
			traditional resume but is adapted for web viewing, making it both familiar and modern.Key features of this page include: 1. A prominent display of my 
			name and professional title at the top, immediately establishing my identity and career focus. 2. Clearly defined sections for Vision Statement, 
			Mission Statement, Future Work Experience, Education, Skills and Qualifications, and Key Projects. 3. The use of a timeline format for work experience 
			and education, providing a clear chronological view of my (projected) career progression. 4. Bullet points for skills and project descriptions, allowing
			for quick scanning of key information. The layout is likely clean and minimalist, in keeping with the professional nature of the content. While 
			maintaining the overall green color scheme of the site, this page might use a more subdued palette to reflect its professional tone. The content is 
			forward-looking, presenting a vision of my future career rather than current experiences. This approach showcases my ambition and long-term planning,
			which could be particularly appealing to potential employers or collaborators. The inclusion of specific projects adds depth to my professional profile, 
			demonstrating practical application of my skills and interests in robotics and AI.</p>
